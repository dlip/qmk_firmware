# Dlip's 28 Key Engram Layout

![](./dlip's-28-key-engram-layout.png)

Based on [Arno's Engram v2.0](https://engram.dev/) layout, which translates wonderfully to this form factor.

## Dual Function keys

I have avoided using combos since homerow combos often caused me misfires and if you move them to less commonly used keys such as the bottom row they are less comfortable for me than a layer on the thumb.

There are some differences in the dual function keys:

- The homerow mods and space use the default style where you must hold the key for a set time (eg. 180 ms) for it to register as a hold. This avoids misfires but does require a short pause which I find acceptable for navigation and mods where you naturally wait for feedback from the application.
