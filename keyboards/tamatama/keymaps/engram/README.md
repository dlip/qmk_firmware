# Dlip's 28 Key Engram Layout

Based on [Arno's Engram v2.0](https://engram.dev/) layout.

## Dual Function keys

I have avoided using combos since homerow combos often caused me misfires and if you move them to less commonly used keys such as the bottom row they are less comfortable for me than a layer on the thumb.

There are some differences in the dual function keys:

- The homerow mods and space use the default style where you must hold the key for a set time (eg. 180 ms) for it to register as a hold. This avoids misfires but does require a short pause which I find acceptable for navigation and mods where you naturally wait for feedback from the application.
- Num and shift use the trigger on other press style making it an instant trigger, the trade off here is you can't 'roll' to another key but I haven't had many issues with tab/bspc
- The combo key is used for typing words with a single chord for which I created this [Abbreviation generator](https://github.com/dlip/abbrgen)

## Mouse Layer

The mouse layer is triggered automatically on movement. The right trackball moves the mouse and the left one scrolls. The scroll button makes the right one scroll when held.
